// 1. What are arrays in JavaScript and why are they useful ?
//JavaScript arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.
// We can store multi datatypes in javasript arrays but it is not recommended
//What if you want to loop through the cars and find a specific one?
// And what if you had not 3 cars, but 300?The solution is an array! https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp

// 2. What are objects in JavaScript and why are they useful ?
    //Objects are methods we create that describes something about

// 3. What are a couple of key differences between objects and arrays ?
    //Arrays have index numbers and objects allow us to access data by object properties.
    //Arrays exist has a window function so it is basically an object i.e. a method described in window.

// 4. What is the index of an array ? What is it used for?
    //we use index to refer a particular element in an array.They also denote sequential data format.

// 5. What is a property ?
    //it is what describes an object like color of car, tyres in a car, type of fuel engine,etc.
    //the association between key and value is called property.

// 6. What is a method ?
    //it is function described in an object for instance to describes how will the car work by using its properties such as tyres and engine,etc.

//7. Create an array named colors that contains five different names of colors as strings.
    var colors = ["red", "blue", "yellow", "violet", "green"]

//8. Access the first color in the array and print it to the console using console.log()
    console.log(colors[0]);
    
//9. Now do the same with the third color in the list. 
    console.log(colors[2]);

//10. Write one line of code that changes the value of the last color in the list to "ultraviolet".
    colors[4] = "ultraviolet"
    console.log(colors);

//11. Create a new variable called fourthColor and set it equal to the fourth color in the list.
    var fourthColor = "black"
    colors[3] = fourthColor
    console.log(colors);

//12. Add another color to the end of the list.
    colors.push("pink");

//13. Add another color to the beginning of the list.
    colors.unshift("white");
    console.log(colors)

//14. Print the length of the array to the console with console.log()
    console.log(colors.length);

//15. Remove the last color from the end of list, and then print the length of the array to the console one more time.
    colors.pop()
    console.log(colors.length);

//16. Write a for loop to iterate through every color in the array and print each color's value to the console.
    for (var i = 0; i < colors.length; i++) {
        console.log(colors[i]);

    }

//17. Copying from that loop you just wrote, modify it to print every color's value and every color's index in this format: 3, purple or 0, blue etc.
    for (var i = 0; i < colors.length; i++) {
        console.log(i + ":" + colors[i]);

    }

//18. Create a variable named lastColor that will always point to the last element of the colors array, no matter how many colors are in the list.
    var last = colors.length - 1;
    var lastColor = colors[last]
    console.log(lastColor);

//19. Pick a penguin from Wikipedia's List of Fictional Penguins and create an object named myPenguin with properties that represent the information listed in each column on that Wikipedia page.
var myPenguin = {
    character: "Sergant Penguin",
    origin: "Donald Duck",
    notes: "A military penguin"
}

//20. Use console.log() to print the penguin's name to the console as part of a welcome message.
//var character = "hello"
console.log("Hello, Im a penguin and my name is" + myPenguin.character);

//21. Write another line of code that adds a new property to your penguin called canFly and set it to false. 
myPenguin.canFly = false

//22. Add a method to your penguin called chirp that prints to the console: "CHIRP CHIRP! Is this what penguins sound like?"

    console.log("CHIRP CHIRP!. Is this what I sound like?");

}
myPenguin.chirp()

//23. Add another method to your penguin called sayHello that prints to the console the same message from step 20 above. 
myPenguin.sayHello = function () {
    console.log("Hello! Im powerful military penguin" + this.character);

}
//24. Next, call your penguin's sayHello() method and make sure that it works.
myPenguin.sayHello()

myPenguin.character = "Penguin"
myPenguin.sayHello()

//26. Write another method called fly, and inside that method, use an if / else statement to print "I can fly!" to the console if your penguin's canFly property is true, or "No flying for me!" if its canFly property is false.
myPenguin.fly = function () {
    if (this.canFly) {

myPenguin.canFly = true

//29. Now call your penguin's fly() method again and make sure it works as expected.
myPenguin.fly()

//30. Write a for ... in loop to print each key to the console.
for (var property in myPenguin) {

//33. Access your penguin's second favorite food and print it to the console using console.log()

//40. Add a new property to your penguin called outfit and set it equal to another object with the following properties: hat, shirt, pants, and shoes -- each property should have a string as its value!

    shirt: "Black shirt",
    pants: "shorts",
